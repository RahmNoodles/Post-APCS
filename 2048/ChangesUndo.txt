Extra Planning: Create MenloStackBoard class that is able to take in an array of StoredBoard
Extra Planning: In J2048Controller class add an instnace of MenloStackBoard called undoStack and implement it
Extra Planning: In StoredBoard create multiple classes that can be called in Controller, View, and Model in order to access and change the StoredBoard instance variables.
